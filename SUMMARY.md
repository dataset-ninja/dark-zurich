**Dark Zurich Dataset** is a dataset for instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, and object detection tasks. It is used in the automotive industry. 

The dataset consists of 8779 images with 508 labeled objects belonging to 19 different classes including *road*, *pole*, *vegetation*, and other: *building*, *traffic sign*, *sky*, *sidewalk*, *terrain*, *fence*, *person*, *wall*, *bicycle*, *rider*, *motorcycle*, *traffic light*, *train*, *car*, *truck*, and *bus*.

Images in the Dark Zurich dataset have pixel-level semantic segmentation annotations. There are 8729 (99% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 3 splits in the dataset: *train* (8377 images), *test* (302 images), and *val* (100 images). Alternatively, the dataset could be split into 3 illumination conditions: ***day*** (3242 images), ***twilight*** (2920 images), and ***night*** (2617 images). Additionally, every image marked with its ***sequence***, ***latitude*** and ***longitude*** tags. The dataset was released in 2019 by the <span style="font-weight: 600; color: grey; border-bottom: 1px dashed #d3d3d3;">Department of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering, ETH, Zurich, Switzerland</span> and <span style="font-weight: 600; color: grey; border-bottom: 1px dashed #d3d3d3;">Department of Electrical Engineering, KU Leuven, Belgium</span>.
